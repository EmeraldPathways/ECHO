Can you fix the styling on the chatbot. It looks bad. The text input section crosses into the send button. The ai text repsonse is plain and ugly

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you improve the styling of your chatbot interface. Let me look at the relevant files to understand the current structure and then make improvements to fix the issues you mentioned. Let me first look at the styling files and components to understand the current implementation: Now let me check the component files, starting with the ChatWindow, MessageInput, and MessageBubble: Based on my review of the code and the screenshot you shared, I can see several styling issues that need to be fixed:

1. The text input section crosses into the send button
2. The AI text responses need better styling

Let me make these improvements. I'll start by fixing the MessageInput component to ensure the input doesn't cross into the button: 
```

```
Now, let's improve the MessageBubble component to make AI responses look better: 
```

```
Let's also update the ChatWindow component to improve the overall styling: 
```

```
Now let's add some custom styling to the `globals.css` to improve the message formatting: 
```

```
Don't worry about the Tailwind errors - these are expected when CSS is being validated without the Tailwind plugin. The styles will still work correctly in your application.

Now let's update the MessageBubble component to use our new CSS classes for better text formatting: 
```

```
I noticed we made a change to use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` which might cause issues with React's type checking. Let's modify the Message type to ensure it handles this correctly: Let's update the MessageBubble component to handle the text properly without using dangerouslySetInnerHTML, which can create security vulnerabilities: 
```

```
Now that we've addressed the issues with the input field overlapping the send button and improved the styling of the AI responses, let's make one final improvement to the ChatWindow to ensure proper spacing and layout: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

I'll continue improving the styling of your chatbot. Let's check the changes we've made so far and see what else we can enhance:

I cant use &&

_**Assistant**_

I understand you can't use the `&&` operator in your environment. Let me continue improving the chatbot styling without using that operator. 

Let's first check the terminal to confirm the environment we're working with: Let's continue improving the styling of the chatbot. I'll make a few more enhancements:

1. First, let's update the input field and button to fix any remaining spacing issues: 
```

```
2. Let's enhance the loading indicator to make it more visually appealing: 
```

```
3. Let's improve the message bubbles further to make them more visually appealing: Let me try again with the MessageBubble component by reading the file first to get the exact content: Now I'll update the MessageBubble component with the exact content: 
```

```
4. Let's enhance the welcome message in the ChatWindow component to make it more appealing: 
```

```
5. Let's add a glow effect to the welcome icon by updating the globals.css: 
```

```
Don't worry about those Tailwind errors, they're expected when CSS is being validated without the Tailwind plugin.

6. Let's improve the main chat container to make the scrolling area cleaner and improve the overall styling: 
```

```
7. Let's add custom scrollbar styles to the `globals.css` file: 
```

```
8. Let's enhance the app layout with a better background: Let me read the file to get the exact content: Now I'll update the `index.tsx` file with the correct content: 
```

```
Now let's run the application to see our changes:

Can you change the open ai model to 3.5 turbo

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll change the OpenAI model from `gpt-4o-mini` to `gpt-3.5-turbo` in the backend code. Let me make that change for you: 
```

```
I've successfully changed the OpenAI model from `gpt-4o-mini` to `gpt-3.5-turbo` in your backend code. This change will make your AI Companion use the GPT-3.5 Turbo model for generating responses.

The GPT-3.5 Turbo model is:
- More economical in terms of API usage costs
- Generally faster in response time
- Still capable of providing good conversational responses for your AI Companion

This change will take effect the next time you restart your backend server. If your server is currently running, you'll need to restart it for the changes to take effect.

Can you restart the backedn server

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you restart the backend server. Let me run the command in the terminal for you: 

---

_**User**_

PS C:\Users\dubli\Downloads\VS CODE\HelpMe\backend> python main.py
INFO:     Started server process [16176]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
ERROR:    [Errno 10048] error while attempting to bind on address ('0.0.0.0', 8000): [winerror 10048] only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted
INFO:     Waiting for application shutdown.
INFO:     Application shutdown complete.

---

_**Assistant**_

It looks like the backend server is already running on port 8000, which is why you're getting the error about "only one usage of each socket address" when trying to start it again. 

Let's first stop the existing server process and then restart it. In Windows PowerShell, we can find and kill the process using the port: Now let's kill the process and restart the server: Now let's restart the backend server with your updated model:

I cant use &&

---

_**Assistant**_

I see you're having an issue with using `&&` in PowerShell. In PowerShell, you typically use `;` to separate commands instead of `&&`. Let me help you stop the current backend server and restart it using PowerShell syntax.

First, let's find the process that's using port 8000:
