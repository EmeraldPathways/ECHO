Can you fix the styling of the web app and get rid of that large icon

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix the styling of the web app and remove the large icon. First, let me examine the current state of the application to understand the issue. Now let me examine the specific issue - it looks like there might be multiple large icons. Let me check the current files to see what's causing the large icon display: I can see from the image that there's a large semicircle icon taking up a lot of space. Based on the code review, it seems the issue might be in how the empty state is displaying or there might be some conflicting CSS. Let me check if there are any missing icon images that might be causing fallback displays, and update the components to create a truly modern, clean chatbot interface.

Let me create a completely modern and minimal design: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

Get rid of all icons for now. 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll remove all icons from the application to create a cleaner interface. Let me update the relevant files to eliminate all icons. Now I'll update all the components to remove the icons:

1. First, I'll remove the icons from the ChatWindow component: 
```

```

```

```
2. Now I'll update the MessageBubble component to remove the user and bot icons: 
```

```
3. Finally, I'll update the MessageInput component to remove the send icon: 
```

```
I've removed all icons from the application to create a cleaner interface:

1. **From the ChatWindow component**:
   - Removed the green status dot icon in the header
   - Removed the welcome message icon
   - Removed the loading animation dots

2. **From the MessageBubble component**:
   - Removed both user and AI avatar icons that appeared beside messages
   - Simplified the message display to just show text bubbles

3. **From the MessageInput component**:
   - Replaced the send arrow icon with simple "Send" text
   - Replaced the loading animation with "..." text

The interface should now be much cleaner without any icons. The focus is entirely on the text content of the messages, and the design is now more minimal and modern.

Can you add to git

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add all the changes to git. First, let me check the current git status to see what changes need to be added. It seems that we're in a git repository but the current directory (`HelpMe`) is not being tracked. Let's initialize git specifically for this project and add the modified files: I need to adjust the command syntax for PowerShell: The git status is showing files from outside our project. Let's initialize a new git repository specifically for the HelpMe project: Now let's check the status of our new repository: Great! Now we have a clean git repository for our project. Let's add all the files to git:

Can you create a proper .gitignore implenmenation

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a proper `.gitignore` file for this Next.js frontend and Python backend project. Let me replace the current `.gitignore` file with a more comprehensive one that includes common files and directories that should be ignored. 
```

```
Now, let me add these files to git and make an initial commit:
