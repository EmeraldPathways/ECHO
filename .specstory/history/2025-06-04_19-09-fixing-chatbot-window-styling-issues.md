# Fixing chatbot window styling issues (2025-06-04 20:09:24)

Can we fix the formatting and spacing issues in the chat window. The chatwindow should fill the space inside the black line

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see the chat window isn't filling the space properly and there might be some CSS issues causing the flashing. Let me check the current state of the files and fix the formatting and spacing issues. I can see the issue! The changes I made earlier weren't applied correctly - the ChatWindow still has the old styling with `border-4 border-primary/30 outline outline-4 outline-primary/50` which is causing the flashing and layout issues. Let me fix this properly: 
```

```
