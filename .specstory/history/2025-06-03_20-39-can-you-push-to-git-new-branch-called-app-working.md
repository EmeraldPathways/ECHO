PS C:\Users\dubli\Downloads\VS CODE\HelpMe> git push -u origin app-working-10pm
fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

_**Assistant**_

It seems like your local repository doesn't have a remote named 'origin' configured, or the URL for 'origin' is not set up correctly.

I'll check your configured remotes.
 It seems like there's no remote repository configured for your local git repository, or the configured remote named "origin" is not accessible.

To fix this, you'll need to add a remote repository. If you have a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub), you can add it using the following command, replacing `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your remote repository:

```shell
git remote add origin <repository_url>
```

After adding the remote, you can try pushing the branch again:

```shell
git push -u origin app-working-10pm
```

If you don't have a remote repository set up yet, you'll need to create one on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

I just want a local git

_**Assistant**_

Okay, your changes are already committed to the local branch `app-working-10pm`. Since you only want a local Git repository, you don't need to push to a remote.

Your commits are saved in your local `` directory. You can continue working and committing to this branch locally.
